# System Calls Learning Environment

A comprehensive educational resource for learning system calls programming in Go, covering file operations and network programming using direct syscalls without standard library wrappers.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project teaches you how programs really interact with the operating system by using direct system calls instead of convenient library functions. You'll build everything from simple "hello world" programs to HTTP servers and educational security demonstrations.
